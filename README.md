#### **About**:
 Callerphone allows you to talk to strangers from other servers through chat. We have censored and uncensored calls, you can even go undercover and be anonymous if you want. If you run into anyone that decides to break [Callerphone's TOS](https://github.com/itsmarsss/Callerphone-Bot/blob/main/assets/TERMSOFSERVICE.md) and or [Discord TOS](https://discord.com/terms), you can always report the other party! Add this bot to your server for your members to socialize and have fun!

**Why?** -
 Why should you choose Callerphone over other bots that do similar things? Callerphone does not randomly disconnect chats or calls and will pair you up with someone as soon as it can! Callerphone even supports permanent channel bridging, connect up to 10 channels together! It can help your server members become more active and socialize more! You can help increase our user-base by inviting Callerphone!
